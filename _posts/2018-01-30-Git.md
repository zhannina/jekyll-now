title: Adding an existing project to github
---

I always forget how to add my local projects (on my machine) to github.
That is why decided to record the steps here. (I am a mac user btw)

So, given that you have an existing project on your machine, <ul> the steps are :
<li> 1. Create a github repo on the github website </li>
<li> 2. Copy the URL of the repo </li>
<li> 3. Go to the terminal and navigate to the directory with the folder </li>
<li> 4. git init </li>
<li> 5. git remote add origin /path/to/origin.git </li>
<li> 6. git add . </li>
<li> 7. git commit -m "initial commit" </li>
<li> 8. git push -u origin master </li>

That's all needed to do to set up a git repo for the already existing project. I always forget adding origin to my repo (step 5), but hopefully not any more.
