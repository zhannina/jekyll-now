I am a PhD student at the [Interaction Design Lab](http://www.cis.unimelb.edu.au/research/groups/interaction-design/) at the [University of Melbourne](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/). My research interests include Ubiquitous Computing and Human-Computer Interaction. In particular I am interested in how different contextual factors affect people's interaction with mobile devices and how this interaction can be improved.
