I have recently attended OzCHI2017 conference where I presented [Challenges of Situational Impairments during Interaction with Mobile Devices]({{ site.baseurl }}/papers/ozchi_challenges.pdf). We got the Honourable Mention Award for this paper. 
It was also my first experience being a Student Volunteer at a conference.
I really enjoyed working with the SV team and handling the SV duties.
